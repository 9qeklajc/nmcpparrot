`nparrot` (_"Nostr Parrot"_) is a convenient CLI tool that facilitates one-on-one DM messaging over Nostr ([NIP-17](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/17.md)).

This tool has a few use cases and benefits:
- ü§ñ Talk to your [Goose AI agent](https://block.github.io/goose/) via DMs from your phone by using any Nostr client compatible with [NIP-17](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/17.md).
- üîó Easily integrate almost any other command line tool with Nostr DMs.
- üîî Send yourself notifications easily from any environment that can run shell commands.
- üß™ Use this as a test or troubleshooting tool for NIP-17 messages.

Here are the features it includes:
- ‚úÖ **`send` command:** Sends a private NIP-17 direct message using specified arguments, or from stdin.
- ‚úÖ **`wait` command:** Listens and waits for the next NIP-17 direct message from a specific user, and prints it to stdout once received.
- ‚úÖ **`onmessage` command:** Continuously listens for NIP-17 direct messages, and for each one, it runs a shell command you specify.
- ‚úÖ **`listen` command:** Continuously listens for NIP-17 direct messages, and for each one, it prints it to stdout.
- ‚úÖ **`mcp` command:** MCP server that allows an AI agent to send a direct message to a specific user, or to wait for their message.
- üÜï **`nostr-memory-mcp` command:** Advanced MCP server that provides persistent memory storage for AI agents using encrypted Nostr DMs.
- üÜï **`combined-mcp` command:** Combined MCP server with chat, search, and command execution capabilities.
- üÜï **`multi-agent-mcp` command:** Multi-agent MCP server for running multiple AI agents in parallel with integrated Nostr memory.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is relatively new, experimental software. Please proceed with caution.

# Installation

We currently don't provide pre-built binaries. If you'd like a pre-built binary, please open an issue or contact us, we can help! Otherwise, please follow the build instructions below.

Make sure you have `cargo` 1.85 or higher installed. Then run:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Then, you can find the executable binary on `./target/release/nparrot`, which you can run from there, or you can move it to another more convenient directory such as `~/.local/bin`.



# Talking to a goose AI agent via Nostr DMs

A very cool use case for this tool is the ability to talk to a [goose AI agent](https://block.github.io/goose/) on your phone, via Nostr DMs.

1. Download any Nostr client that supports NIP-17 DMs on your phone (e.g. [0xchat](https://www.0xchat.com)).
2. Go through onboarding.
3. Go to your profile, and find your npub (This will be in the form `npub1...`). Take note of that, this will be your `TARGET_PUBKEY`.
4. Also find and take note of the relays you are connected to. (e.g. `wss://relay.damus.io`). This will be your `RELAY_URL`.
5. Now, switch to your computer.
6. Generate a nostr private key (nsec) for your AI agent. If you have [`nak`](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak), this can be done by simply running:
```
nak key generate | nak encode nsec
```
7. Take note of the `nsec` generated in the previous step, this will be your `NSEC`.
8. Now run these commands to set the variables on your environment (this helps make nparrot commands less verbose):
```
export TARGET_PUBKEY=<Your pubkey from step 3>
export NSEC=<Your nsec from step 6>
export RELAY_URL=<Your relay from step 4>
```
9. **Optional but recommended:** Send yourself a message to test if the setup works.
```
nparrot send "test"
```
9. **Optional but recommended:** Create a working directory where your AI agent will be working on, and `cd` to it.
10. **Optional but recommended:** Create a `.goosehints` on your working directory, with context to help the AI agent understand it should send you a message via Nostr DMs and not directly to the terminal. Example:
```markdown
- Talk to the user over nostr messaging using the tool provided.
- The user's name is Daniel
- Before you start doing any task, send a message to the user first saying indicating you are working on it
- You should always reply to the user over nostr, your normal output is not monitored.
```
9. Finally, run this command to start:
```
nparrot onmessage 'sed "s/^/New message from Nostr: /" | goose run --name="test-session" --with-extension "nparrot mcp" -i -'
```
10. Try sending a message from your app, and see your AI agent respond to it!

Notes:
- During testing, gpt-4o was used with good results

# AI Agent Memory with Nostr

The `nostr-memory-mcp` command provides a powerful memory system for AI agents using Nostr's encrypted direct messages. This allows agents to store and retrieve persistent memories across sessions.

## Features

üß† **Memory Operations**: Store, retrieve, update, and delete memory entries  
üîê **Privacy**: All memories encrypted using Nostr NIP-17  
üìã **Types**: Support for user preferences, context, facts, instructions, and notes  
üìÇ **Categories**: Organize memories by personal, work, project, or general categories  
üè∑Ô∏è **Tags**: Tag-based organization and filtering  
üìä **Statistics**: Get insights about stored memories  
üßπ **Cleanup**: Automatic expiry and cleanup of old memories  

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set up environment
export NSEC=nsec1...
export TARGET_PUBKEY=npub1...

# Start the memory server
./nparrot nostr-memory-mcp
```

For detailed usage instructions, see [NOSTR_MEMORY_MCP_USAGE.md](NOSTR_MEMORY_MCP_USAGE.md).

# Enhanced Multi-Agent System

The `multi-agent-mcp` command now includes integrated Nostr memory capabilities, allowing agents to have persistent memory across sessions.

## Key Features

ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Deploy and manage multiple AI agents in parallel  
üß† **Persistent Memory**: Agents can store and recall information using Nostr  
üîÑ **Local Fallback**: Memory system works even when Nostr is unavailable  
üìä **Agent Management**: Create, monitor, and coordinate multiple agent instances  
üéØ **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic agent selection based on task requirements  

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set up environment for memory functionality
export NSEC=nsec1...
export TARGET_PUBKEY=npub1...

# Start the enhanced multi-agent server
./nparrot multi-agent-mcp
```

Available agent types:
- **FuxScout** (search): Information gathering and research
- **FuxCoder** (goose): Development and engineering tasks  
- **FuxManager** (enhanced): Project coordination and management
- **FuxSpecialist** (combined): Multi-domain expertise
- **FuxComm** (chat): Communication coordination

For detailed information, see [MULTI_AGENT_NOSTR_MEMORY.md](MULTI_AGENT_NOSTR_MEMORY.md).
