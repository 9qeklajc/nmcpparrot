Write a short, focused **Markdown response** that outlines:
- The goals of the MVP
- Only the features that can be built in a 40-60 minute session
- Any helpful design considerations

- Decide what work can be done in parallel vs what must be sequential
- Output the task breakdown in Markdown format

Create a clear task breakdown showing:

2. Parallel tasks that can be done simultaneously
3. Dependencies between tasks
4. Estimated effort for each task (simple/medium/complex)",

✅ Do NOT install packages — just scaffold the structure
