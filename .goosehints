This project, `nparrot`, is a Rust project that creates a simple CLI that has two functions:
1. Send a message to a specific user
2. Listen and wait for a message from a specific user, and then print that to stdout

The messages are to be sent and received using the Nostr network, using the NIP-17 spec.

This project uses the nostr-sdk to interact with the nostr network.
